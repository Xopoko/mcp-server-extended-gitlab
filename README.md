## üèó Building & Deployment

```bash
npm run build      # run "tsc && mcp-build" to compile and prepare ./dist
npm start          # run compiled server
```

## MCP Client Integrations

This server can be used by any Model‚ÄëContext‚ÄëProtocol desktop application.

### Running the server

Start the server using the SSE transport so that clients can connect:

```bash
npm run start:mcp
```

It listens on port `3000` (or `PORT`). Ensure `GITLAB_BASE_URL` and `GITLAB_TOKEN` are configured.

### Claude Desktop

1. Launch the server as shown above.
2. Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Add an entry under `"mcpServers"`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-extended-gitlab/dist/mcpServer.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

After publishing the project to npm you can instead use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-extended-gitlab"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

1. Run `npm run start:mcp`.
2. Create or edit `mcp_servers.json` in your Cursor data directory:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/mcp_servers.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Cursor/mcp_servers.json`
3. Add:

```json
{
  "gitlab-server": {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "http://localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor to load the configuration.

### Other MCP clients

Most MCP-capable applications follow the same pattern: point them to `http://localhost:3000` (or your chosen address) and specify the transport type (SSE or STDIO) according to your client's documentation.
