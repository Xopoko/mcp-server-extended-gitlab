## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
npm install

npm test

npm run build

npm start
# -> http://localhost:3000/health  => {"status":"ok"}
```

### Environment Variables

Set the following variables to connect to your GitLab instance:

```bash
GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4
GITLAB_TOKEN=your-private-token
# optionally limit exposed tools
# use a comma-separated list
# TOOLS_INCLUDE=projects,merge_requests
# or exclude certain tools
# TOOLS_EXCLUDE=pipelines
# TOOLS_INCLUDE takes precedence if both are set
```

### Filtering Available Tools

By default the server loads all GitLab tools. To restrict the available set you
can provide an **include** or **exclude** list:

- **Environment variables** ‚Äì set `TOOLS_INCLUDE` or `TOOLS_EXCLUDE` to a comma-
  separated list. If both are defined, `TOOLS_INCLUDE` wins.

  ```bash
  TOOLS_INCLUDE=projects,merge_requests npm run start:mcp
  # or
  TOOLS_EXCLUDE=pipelines npm run start:mcp
  ```

- **Programmatic API** ‚Äì pass `includes` or `excludes` to `createMcpServer()`:

  ```ts
  import { createMcpServer } from 'mcp-server-extended-gitlab';

  const server = await createMcpServer({ includes: ['projects', 'merge_requests'] });
  await server.start();
  ```

- **Config file** ‚Äì supply a JSON file when creating the server. Use the
  `configPath` option pointing to a file like:

  ```json
  {
    "includes": ["projects", "merge_requests"]
  }
  ```

  ```ts
  const server = await createMcpServer({ configPath: 'mcp.config.json' });
  ```

Use this when embedding the server in another application. Remember that the
include list overrides the exclude list if both are supplied.

## üèó Building & Deployment

```bash
npm run build      # run "tsc && mcp-build" to compile and prepare ./dist
npm start          # run compiled server
```

## MCP Client Integrations

This server can be used by any Model‚ÄëContext‚ÄëProtocol desktop application.

### Running the server

Start the server using the SSE transport so that clients can connect:

```bash
npm run start:mcp
```

It listens on port `3000` (or `PORT`). Ensure `GITLAB_BASE_URL` and `GITLAB_TOKEN` are configured.
Use `TOOLS_INCLUDE` or `TOOLS_EXCLUDE` to control which tools are loaded.

### Claude Desktop

1. Launch the server as shown above.
2. Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Add an entry under `"mcpServers"`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-extended-gitlab/dist/mcpServer.js"],
      "env": {
        "TOOLS_INCLUDE": "projects,merge_requests"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After publishing the project to npm you can instead use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-extended-gitlab", "--includes=projects,merge_requests"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

1. Run `npm run start:mcp` (append `-- --includes=projects,merge_requests` to limit tools).
2. Create or edit `mcp_servers.json` in your Cursor data directory:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/mcp_servers.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Cursor/mcp_servers.json`
3. Add:

```json
{
  "gitlab-server": {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "http://localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor to load the configuration.

### Other MCP clients

Most MCP-capable applications follow the same pattern: point them to `http://localhost:3000` (or your chosen address) and specify the transport type (SSE or STDIO) according to your client's documentation.
